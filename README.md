# Sublime-settings
This repository contains my personal Sublime Text 3 settings.

## Usage
Clone the directory into your `${Packages}/User/` folder (or perhaps a subdirectory). Make sure that you have the [Package Control *package*][Package Control] installed. It will then automatically install all of the packages that are described in the `Package Control.sublime-settings` file (under the field `"installed_packages"`).

[Package Control]: https://packagecontrol.io/installation

## Subdirectories
Each subdirectory can contain language specific set-ups such as snippets (`.sublime-snippet`), key-maps (`.sublime-keymap`) and settings (`.sublime-settings`).
